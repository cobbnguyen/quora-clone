This was one of my final projects at App Academy. I am still building it out a little, but most of the functionality 
has been finished since the first week. PostgreSQL database, Rails back-end, Javascript/jQuery on the client side

Features:

-authentication: from scratch  

-questions: ask questions, and tag them with topics. Questions filtered by topic 

-answers: answer other people's questions (or your own). Remove answers you have posted.

-follow subjects: on sign-up, choose subjects to follow

-voting: upvote or downvote other people's answers

-comments: comment on answers

-news feed: gives you a summary of recent activity you might be interested in

-follow questions: add questions to your feed

-most popular: list of questions with the most answers/comments

-trending topics: lists topics with the most questions tagged with them 


Side note: Recently I discovered that I had been committing under the name 'App Academy Student' because I'd been working on their computers. oh well. I swear I'm not stealing this from anyone...
